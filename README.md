# Anxiety treatment

Anxiety disorder is a condition that became widely spread in the world in the last years. This site comes as a help for those who struggle with moderate anxiety and don't require medical treatment. Its content, features and tools are inspired from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy(CBT), a method successfully used in psychoterapy.

## User Experience(UX)

The site has two levels of access of the informations and content: with or without logging with an account.

### Without account

Being a sensitive subject, I created an option for the users that are not yet convinced to create an account and start practising. On the first page there is a brief description of anxiety disorder and two detailed articles about symptoms and treatment. This comes as general information that can be accessed by anybody and is like a preview before creating an account. Having these informations, an user can decide if it will go further or not.

### With account

An user can create and login to his own account. When logged in, a dashboard page opens, that contains informations about CBT and picture-links to the two features available, named tools: journal and TFB-cycle. In journal, as its name says, the user can keep a personal journal, he can add new entries, edit them or delete them. In TFB cycle, the process rely on identifying an Hot Tought and debrief it taking in consideration all of the physical and mental implications that it have. The user has a detailed form that he can use to add a new entry, to edit it or to delete it.
Privacy of toughts is very important in general and in special in these kind of conditions. That is why, an user can see only his own entries.
